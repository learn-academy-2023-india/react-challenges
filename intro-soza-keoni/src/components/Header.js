// <!-- ⭐️ Challenge: Favorites
// As a developer, you are tasked with creating an application to share your favorite things. Decide which favorite things you would like to showcase. When creating a project, it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code into individual components.

// 📚 User Stories
// As a user, I can see a Header component with the title of your app.
// As a user, I can see a Profile component with information about you and your partner.
// As a user, I can see a Footer component with the name of your cohort.
// As a user, I can see a Favorite component with a list of top five favorites (i.e. top five favorite TV shows, top five favorite songs, top five favorite taco shops).
// 🏔 Stretch Goals
// As a user, I can see a browser tab with a customized name and favicon.
