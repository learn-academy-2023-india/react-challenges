// ‚≠êÔ∏è Challenge: Favorites
// As a developer, you are tasked with creating an application to share your favorite things. Decide which favorite things you would like to showcase. When creating a project, it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code into individual components.

// üìö User Stories
// As a user, I can see a Header component with the title of your app.
// As a user, I can see a Profile component with information about you and your partner.
// As a user, I can see a Footer component with the name of your cohort.
// As a user, I can see a Favorite component with a list of top five favorites (i.e. top five favorite TV shows, top five favorite songs, top five favorite taco shops).
// üèî Stretch Goals
// As a user, I can see a browser tab with a customized name and favicon.

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function

// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
