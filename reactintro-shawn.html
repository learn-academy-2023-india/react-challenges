<!-- Challenge: React Components
The goal of the following challenge is for us to practice nesting components and getting familiar with the component syntax.

Create a new HTML file. Copy the following code into your file: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <title>Intro to React</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="react-container"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">

      const App = () => {
        return (
        <>
        <Cohort />
        </>
        )
      }

      const Cohort = () => {
        return (
            <>
                <h1> India Cohort </h1>
                <Content />
            </>
        )
      }

      const Content = () => {
        return <h3>Welcome to LEARN Academy!</h3>
      }

      const domContainer = document.querySelector("#react-container")
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer)
      root.render(<App />)

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
